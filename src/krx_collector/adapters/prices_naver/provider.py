"""Daily OHLCV from Naver's chart endpoint, with no KRX contact at all (K-5).

This replaces ``prices_pykrx``, and the reason is not the data — it is identical.
``pykrx.stock.get_market_ohlcv_by_date`` defaults to ``adjusted=True``, and that
branch calls ``pykrx.website.naver``, which fetches exactly the URL below.  KRX
never sees the request.

What KRX *did* see was the import.  ``pykrx/website/comm/webio.py`` runs
``_session = build_krx_session()`` at module scope, so ``from pykrx import
stock`` performs a KRX login — a warmup GET, a login-page GET and a login POST —
before any collector asks for anything.  Every ``prices backfill`` therefore
logged in to KRX to download data from Naver.  Nor can that be dodged by
importing a narrower module: ``pykrx.website.naver.core`` imports ``Get`` from
that same ``webio``.

So the wrapper goes and the request stays.  KRX restricted this host on
2026-08-16 for automated collection; a login that buys nothing is the easiest
KRX traffic to stop sending.

Response shape, verified live on 2026-08-18 (``symbol=005930&count=5``)::

    \n\n<?xml version="1.0" encoding="EUC-KR" ?>
    <protocol><chartdata symbol="005930" name="삼성전자" count="5" timeframe="day">
      <item data="20260814|275000|275500|266000|274500|21669476" />
    </chartdata></protocol>

An unknown ticker answers ``<protocol />`` — no ``chartdata``, still a valid
document — and a delisted one answers with its real history (``001529`` returns
bars ending in 2022).  So "no bars" is normal and must not read as a failure.

Three properties of the response drive the code below.

1. **``count`` counts bars back from today, not from the requested range.**  The
   endpoint takes no start date, so reaching a start in 2015 means asking for
   every bar since.  Calendar days over-count trading days, which is the safe
   direction: ask for more bars than needed and filter.
2. **The declared encoding is EUC-KR**, and ``xml.etree.ElementTree`` refuses
   bytes carrying a multi-byte encoding declaration ("multi-byte encodings are
   not supported").  So the bytes are decoded here — explicitly, rather than
   through ``response.text``, which would guess ISO-8859-1 if the header ever
   lost its charset — and the decoded string is what gets parsed.  Only the
   company name is non-ASCII and this adapter never reads it, so a decode error
   is replaced rather than raised.

3. **Blank lines precede the XML declaration**, which ElementTree rejects
   outright ("XML or text declaration not at start of entity").  The payload is
   stripped before parsing.
