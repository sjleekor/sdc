"""Shared helpers for pykrx import-time KRX authentication.

pykrx authenticates once, at import, in ``pykrx.website.comm.webio``. That single
fact produces two distinct failure modes, and the N3 snapshot backfill hit both
on the night of 2026-08-15.

Failure 1 — the session dies mid-run
------------------------------------
pykrx re-logs in only when its own clock says the session expired (one hour,
minus a five-minute buffer). It has no notion of the server having dropped the
session first, and KRX does drop it first: a process would work for two to four
minutes and then every response came back as an error page, while pykrx kept
sending dead cookies because its clock still said the session was good. Round 1
wrote 23 snapshots in 127s at 0.5s pacing; round 2 wrote 14 in 253s at 1.5s. The
*slower* run got *fewer* rows before dying, so the pace was not what was being
punished — process lifetime was.

:func:`call_with_session_retry` handles this by keying on the response instead of
the clock. Both ``Get`` and ``Post`` resolve their session through the
module-global the auth module owns, and ``KRXSession.refresh`` mutates that
object in place, so re-logging in there fixes every pykrx call at once.

Failure 2 — the login endpoint itself goes down
-----------------------------------------------
Because the login runs at import, a login that returns HTML makes ``import
pykrx`` raise, and no amount of call-level retry can reach that: there is no
call, the library never loads. From roughly 23:54 KST the whole library was
unimportable, one probe slipped through at 00:11, and after 00:19 nothing worked
at all. The KRX MDC collectors, which authenticate separately, kept working
throughout — so this is upstream, not credentials.

:class:`KrxLoginUnavailableError` exists to say that in one line. Left raw it
surfaced as forty lines of traceback per target date, ending in "Expecting
value: line 13 column 1", naming nothing.

The operational consequence is scheduling, not code: run pykrx backfills well
clear of midnight, and let the circuit breaker stop the run when they are not.
