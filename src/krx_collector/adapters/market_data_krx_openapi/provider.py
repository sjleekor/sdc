"""KRX Open API market-cap and universe providers.

One request returns a whole market-day.  Verified live on 2026-08-18
(``basDd=20260814``): KOSPI 942 rows, KOSDAQ 1,821 rows, 15 fields::

    {"BAS_DD": "20260814", "ISU_CD": "095570", "ISU_NM": "AJ네트웍스",
     "MKT_NM": "KOSPI", "SECT_TP_NM": "", "TDD_CLSPRC": "4520",
     "CMPPREVDD_PRC": "100", "FLUC_RT": "2.26", "TDD_OPNPRC": "4435",
     "TDD_HGPRC": "4545", "TDD_LWPRC": "4435", "ACC_TRDVOL": "74511",
     "ACC_TRDVAL": "334258460", "MKTCAP": "204542470680",
     "LIST_SHRS": "45252759"}

Three properties of that response drive the code below, and each of them
differs from the pykrx path this replaces.

1. **A non-trading day returns zero rows.**  ``basDd=20260817`` (a substitute
   holiday) returned an empty ``OutBlock_1``.  pykrx instead returns every
   ticker with the price columns zeroed, which is why the pykrx adapter has to
   pass ``alternative=False`` and treat ``종가 == 0`` as "not a real row".
   Neither guard is needed here: absence is expressed as absence.

2. **Every value is a string**, including the numeric ones, and a field can be
   an empty string.  Parsing is explicit and an unparseable value becomes
   ``None`` rather than zero — a zero that cannot be told from a real zero is
   the bug the pykrx adapter had to work around.

3. **``MKT_NM`` exists but is not used to fill ``market``.**  The endpoint is
   already market-specific, so the call argument is authoritative and cheaper
   to trust.  ``SECT_TP_NM`` is *not* an industry: it is the KOSDAQ 소속부
   (벤처기업부 / 중견기업부) and is blank for KOSPI.  It is deliberately not
   mapped anywhere near N2's ``induty_code``.

    Conforms to :class:`~krx_collector.ports.universe.UniverseProvider`, and
    replaces the FDR path that ``universe sync`` used (K-5).

    The replacement is about permission, not volume.  ``fdr.StockListing`` reads
    its listing rows from a GitHub CSV cache, but it first calls
    ``data.krx.co.kr/comm/bldAttendant/executeForResourceBundle.cmd`` — twice per
    call, the second one a duplicate — purely to learn ``max_work_dt``.  That is
    four anonymous MDC requests per daily run, outside our throttle and outside
    our accounting, for a field the official endpoint gives us as part of the
    answer.  KRX restricted this host for automated collection (K-0), so the
    question is not how much traffic it is; it is which door it goes through.

    Two fields carry real gains over FDR: ``LIST_DD`` is a listing date from the
    exchange rather than FDR's best-effort column, and ``SECUGRP_NM`` /
    ``KIND_STKCERT_TP_NM`` finally make the universe's composition visible.
    Nothing is filtered on them here — narrowing the universe is N3-3's decision
    and would change what every downstream table covers — but the breakdown is
    logged so that decision can be made from counts instead of guesses.

    One behaviour FDR did not need: **this endpoint is dated, and today's file
    is not published all day.**  Measured 2026-08-18 at 16:04 KST, after the
    15:30 close, ``basDd=20260818`` still returned zero rows.  FDR reads a cache
    that always answers, so a daily job never saw this.  When the caller does
    not name a date, the provider therefore asks for the most recent day that
    actually has data and labels the snapshot with *that* date — which is what
