    One method rather than one per endpoint, unlike the other DART ports. The
    five DS002 endpoints take identical arguments (``corp_code`` +
    ``bsns_year`` + ``reprt_code``) and return identically-shaped raw rows, so
    five methods would be five copies differing only in a URL — and the service
    would still have to switch on statement type to build its slice keys. The
    enum carries the distinction instead, which keeps it type-checked.
