"""Port: Daily market-cap provider interface.

Any adapter that can supply KRX market cap / trading value / listed shares for
a whole market on one date must conform to ``MarketCapProvider``.

The unit of work is a ``(trade_date, market)`` SLICE, not a ticker.  Fetching
by date is roughly a thousand times cheaper than looping tickers, and the
per-market split is not an optimisation choice — the response carries no market
column, so one request per market is the only way to fill it without joining
``stock_master`` (which would leak a stock's present-day market backwards).
