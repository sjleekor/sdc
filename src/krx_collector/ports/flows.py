"""Ports: security flow provider interfaces.

There are two, because the two upstreams have genuinely different work units:

* :class:`FlowProvider` — ``(trade_date, market) -> every ticker``. KRX MDC.
* :class:`TickerFlowProvider` — ``(ticker) -> a date range``. KIS Developers.

Collapsing them into one protocol would mean the KIS side answering a
whole-market question one ticker at a time, throwing away the 30-100 sessions
per call that make it cheap, and leaving the failure unit ("which market-day
is missing") a lie — under KIS a failure is a *per-ticker hole*.  Keeping them
apart lets each service checkpoint the unit it actually retries.
