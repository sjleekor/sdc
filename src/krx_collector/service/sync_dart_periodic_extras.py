"""Use-case: Sync OpenDART DS002 periodic-report extras (N6).

This is the first collector to resume from ``collection_slice_state`` (L-1)
rather than from ``ingestion_runs.params``, and it is the reason that ledger
exists. The backfill is ~83,700 calls over about a day and a half, spanning
several OpenDART daily-limit stops. The old mechanism cannot survive that: the
no-data tombstone list is capped per run and only recent runs are read back, so
a job spread over three days cannot reconstruct its own progress.

Two response shapes cut the call count from 162,000 to 83,700, and both are
expressed here as year arithmetic rather than as extra requests:

* ``hyslrChgSttus`` returns the *accumulated* change history — a 2023 request
  came back with changes going to 2019 — so 12 years cost 3 requests, not 12.
  ``change_on`` in the payload keeps each event's date exact, which is why
  annual collection is enough for a transition feature.
* the audit-opinion endpoint returns 당기/전기/전전기 in one response, so 12
  years cost 6 requests.

Each step is the measured span minus one, so consecutive requests overlap by a
year and no boundary year can fall between two of them.
