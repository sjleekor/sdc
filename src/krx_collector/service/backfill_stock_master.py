"""Recover historical securities into ``stock_master`` from the PIT snapshots.

Why this exists
---------------
``UniverseScope.HISTORICAL`` promises "every row in the stock master regardless
of listing status", and it delivers exactly that — but the master itself only
knows what the collector has watched since it started running in 2026-04. Every
security delisted before then is simply absent.

Measured 2026-08-16: of the 3,959 corporations that ever carried a ticker,
**1,299 have no row in ``stock_master`` at all**, and on the first 24 reconstructed
month-end snapshots, 372 tickers appear that the master has never heard of — and
all 372 have zero rows in ``daily_ohlcv``. The two counts match exactly, which is
the whole point: **membership in ``stock_master`` is what decides price coverage.**

Absent from the master means unreachable, not merely un-fetched. Price collection
resolves its targets from that table, and naming a missing ticker through
``--tickers`` returns nothing, because the allowlist is filtered against the same
table. No flag reaches past it.

So the fix is not another scope or another flag; it is making the master contain
what it claims to contain. The N3 month-end snapshots are the point-in-time record
of what was listed, they come from the same source as the prices, and they carry
the market per ticker — so they are what the recovery reads.

What it does not do
-------------------
Nothing here is marked ``ACTIVE``. A ticker absent from ``stock_master`` was never
seen by a live universe sync, so it is not listed today, and it is written as
``DELISTED``. ``sync_universe`` computes its delisting diff from
``get_active_stocks``, so these rows are invisible to it and cannot disturb the
live universe.

Month-end snapshots also cannot see a security that listed and delisted inside a
single month. That is a known floor on recall, not a silent one.
