"""Use-case: Sync OpenDART company profiles (industry / incorporation / FY end).

``corpCode.xml``, which fills ``dart_corp_master`` today, carries only
corp_code / corp_name / stock_code / modify_date.  Industry code comes from a
separate per-corporation endpoint, and its absence is why every cross-sectional
z-score in ``fin_scan.py`` partitions on ``(trade_date, market)`` alone — banks,
biotech, shipbuilders and game studios all normalise against one KOSPI pool.

Targets are the ~3,959 corporations with a ticker mapping.  Including unlisted
entities would multiply the request count by about thirty for rows no feature
ever reads.

Skip-if-present is ``profile_fetched_at IS NOT NULL``.  One call per
corporation with no sub-parts, so there is no partial-response hazard here —
unlike the slice-based collectors, a row either has its profile or it does not.

Every fetch is also appended to ``dart_corp_profile_history`` (F-1).  The
master row is an upsert and forgets the previous ``induty_code``, which is why
industry is a *current* value in this repository and why every
industry-neutral variant in the marts is a diagnostic rather than a feature.
KRX index membership is not published and the KRX-to-KSIC crosswalk resolved
only 36% of tickers 1:1, so versioning this endpoint monthly from now on is the
only remaining route to a point-in-time industry.  It buys nothing for the
past: the history starts the month it starts.  See
``docs/dev/20260907_additional_feature/01_industry_pit.md`` §2.
