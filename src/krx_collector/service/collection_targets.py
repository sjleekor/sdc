"""The single place that decides what a collection targets.

Before this module every service resolved its own targets, and every one of
them independently reached for the currently-listed set::

    storage.get_dart_corp_master(active_only=True, tickers=tickers)   # x5
    storage.get_active_stocks(market)                                 # prices

Six independent decisions, all the same, all invisible — and all wrong for a
historical backfill.  The measured result was 2.0-2.3% coverage of the 1,330
delisted names in every DART raw table and in ``daily_ohlcv``, and 13.9% of the
2016 cross-section missing (``poc/survivorship_gap.md``).

Adding an opt-in flag per service does not fix that: the next collector will
default the same way.  Routing every service through these two functions gives
one place that knows about ``active_only`` / ``get_stocks``, and
``tests/unit/test_collection_targets.py`` fails if a service goes around them.
