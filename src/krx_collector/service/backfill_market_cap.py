"""Use-case: Backfill daily KRX market cap / trading value / listed shares.

The unit of work is a ``(trade_date, market)`` SLICE — one provider call
returns every listed stock on that date and market.

Two rules shape this service and both come from
``01_implementation_checklist.md`` 2.4.

**A slice is complete only when the stored row count matches the response.**
"Some rows exist, therefore done" would permanently strand any slice that was
interrupted mid-write: the skip rule would never look at it again.  So the skip
decision compares stored counts against what the provider actually returned,
and a mismatch leaves the slice incomplete and retryable.

**Holidays are not fetched.**  pykrx does not return an empty frame for a
non-session date — it returns every ticker with the prices zeroed.  The KRX
trading calendar filters those out before any request is made; the adapter's
zero-close drop is the second line of defence, not the first.

**Pacing is the KRX policy, not a local number.**  pykrx reaches the same
``data.krx.co.kr`` portal the MDC collectors do, so it gets the same
:class:`~krx_collector.util.pipeline.HumanThrottle`: randomised spacing, a
periodic long rest, and a real backoff after an error.  This service used to
sleep a flat ``rate_limit_seconds`` with no error backoff at all — 0.4s in the
deployed wrapper against the MDC path's 1.5–4.0s — and on 2026-08-16 KRX
restricted the collector's IP for "자동화 수단을 통한 비정상 대량 조회".  One
setting for one host is the point; two paces for the same portal was the defect.

        throttle: KRX pacing policy.  ``None`` means no pacing, which is for
            tests; the CLI always supplies one built from the KRX settings.
        force: Re-fetch slices that are already complete.
