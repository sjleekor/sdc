"""Use-case: Data validation.

**Missing-bar checks resolve the universe AS OF the validated date.** Comparing
a past date against today's active set is structurally blind: the tickers that
are missing are exactly the ones that have since delisted, so they are absent
from both sides. That is how 13.9% of the 2016 cross-section stayed
uncollected without any check reporting it (``poc/survivorship_gap.md``).

1. **OHLC sanity rules**
   - low <= open <= high
   - low <= close <= high
   - All prices > 0 (unless delisted/halted — volume == 0 allowed)
   - Volume >= 0

2. **Missing-day checks**
   - Compare stored trade dates against the trading calendar.
   - Flag tickers with gaps (excluding holidays and weekends).
   - Use ``infra.calendar.trading_days`` for the calendar strategy.

3. **Universe count drift checks** (implemented)
   - Compare consecutive snapshot ``record_count`` values within a source.
   - Alert when the change exceeds ``universe_drift_pct`` (default ±5%).
   - Sources are compared separately: a backfilled snapshot and a live one
     come from different collection paths, so a step between them says
     nothing about the market.

4. **Cross-source consistency** (future)
   - Compare FDR vs pykrx universe snapshots for the same date.
   - Flag discrepancies in ticker sets or names.
