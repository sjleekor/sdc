"""Domain-specific profiling check builders, keyed by id.

These absorb the per-table "특화 분석" items from ``PLAN.md`` §4 without
spawning one analyzer module per table.  A spec lists check ids in
``domain_checks``; the query runner dispatches each through this registry.

Each builder takes ``(runner, spec, title)`` and returns a
:class:`CheckResult`.  Builders reuse the runner's private SQL helpers, so
they share the same identifier-whitelisting and timeout guarantees.  All
identifiers are still emitted via ``psycopg2.sql.Identifier``.
