"""Per-slice completion ledger for backfills that outlive a single run (L-1).

Every collector here already skips work it has done. Two of those mechanisms
stop working once a backfill gets large enough:

**"the slice has rows, so it is done" is not completion.** If a response is
half-written and the process dies, that slice has rows forever and every later
run skips it. Nothing repairs it, and nothing reports it. The fix is to record
what the response *carried* alongside what storage *wrote*, and to call a slice
done only when the two agree.

**``ingestion_runs.params`` cannot hold the answer for a multi-day backfill.**
The no-data tombstone list is capped per run and only the newest runs are read
back, so a job spanning three days cannot reconstruct its own progress. N6 is
~84,000 calls over about three days — exactly the case that breaks.

So the state moves into ``collection_slice_state``, keyed by
``(source, endpoint, slice_key)``. This module is the only thing collectors
need to touch: :meth:`SliceLedger.plan` decides what to fetch, and the three
``record_*`` methods report back.

Build it once and share it. A ledger written per work package is a ledger with
per-package bugs.
