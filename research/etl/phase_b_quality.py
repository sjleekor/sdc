"""§7.1 raw-side quality diagnostics for Phase B (B-10 Stage 2).

Two of the seven ``*_quality``/``*_coverage`` artifacts the run directory
contract lists. Both sit directly on raw, before any feature mart, and answer
"is the source good enough to build on" rather than "is the feature any good":

``filing_receipt_quality``   per receipt year — how much of the disclosure
                             receipt history landed, how much of it is a
                             correction rather than an original filing, and how
                             much was corrected later. B-1 step 6 needs the
                             correction count to size the receipt-targeted XBRL
                             backfill; SUE needs it because a revision must
                             never be counted as a new event (§3.5).

``capital_change_quality``   per (vintage year, report code) — placeholder vs
                             real event rows, unclassified ``isu_dcrs_stle``
                             coverage, and, for annual vintages, how much this
                             vintage disagrees with the newest one. The last
                             part reuses the §4.4.1 probe so vintage duplication
                             stays a standing measurement instead of a one-off.

Both are pure SQL over registered views, so the phase B runner can materialize
them the same way it materializes everything else in the run directory.
