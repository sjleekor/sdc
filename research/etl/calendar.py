"""dim_trading_calendar — the market-level trading-day index (``d_idx``).

This is the single source of truth for "what is N trading days later" across the
whole pipeline. Forward returns (label horizon) and walk-forward embargo/purge
must all be expressed in ``d_idx``, never calendar days, so that market holidays
and per-ticker halts are absorbed (etl_00 §2.1, §5 and the §9 checklist:
"t+20는 캘린더가 아니라 거래일 인덱스 기준인가").

Grain: ``(market, trade_date)`` with a dense per-market ``d_idx`` starting at 1.
A market trading day is any date present in ``daily_ohlcv`` for that market.

See ``docs/target/00_shared_etl_platform.md`` §1 (dim_trading_calendar) and
``docs/target/01_20_access_return_rank/etl_03_implementation_plan.md`` §4 (P2).
