"""dim_universe_daily — per-(trade_date, ticker, market) eligibility flags.

Implements the etl_00 §1.2 universe filter as *auditable boolean columns* (one
per condition) plus a combined ``in_universe`` gate, so the reason a name is
in/out on a given day is inspectable rather than hidden in a WHERE clause.

Filter conditions (etl_00 §1.2):
  1) row exists at t AND not halted        -> ``not_halted``
  2) >= min_valid of trailing window valid  -> ``warmup_ok``   (new-listing/long-halt guard)
  3) trailing avg turnover >= floor         -> ``liquidity_ok`` (low-liquidity noise guard)
  4) t+H close exists                        -> ``label_ok``     (label producible; TRAIN ONLY)

``in_universe`` = not_halted AND warmup_ok AND liquidity_ok. Condition 4 is kept
*separate* because it must only be applied to the train/validation set, never at
inference time where the future does not exist (etl_00 §1.2).

Conventions (verified on the lake):
  - ``is_halted := (open=0 AND high=0 AND low=0)`` — pykrx halt-day convention, ~1.6%.
  - ``turnover  := close * volume`` cast to DOUBLE (Decimal128 overflow guard, etl_01 §3).
  - Forward existence uses the *per-ticker non-halt trading-day index* (etl_00 §2.1),
    so t+H means H of the ticker's own real sessions later — consistent with the label.

See ``docs/target/01_20_access_return_rank/etl_00_ridge_elasticnet.md`` §1.2 and
``etl_03_implementation_plan.md`` §4 (P2).
