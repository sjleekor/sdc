"""§4.4.1 vintage distance probe — how much do capital-change vintages disagree?

``irdsSttus`` reprints the whole since-listing capital-action history in every
annual report, so ``dart_capital_change_raw`` holds one copy of each real event
per report vintage. §4.4.1 fixes the dedup rule (one vintage per ticker, used
whole) but leaves the *choice* of vintage to measurement:

    latest_vintage  the newest report, used for every filing position
    strict_pit      per position, the newest report already disclosed then

This module computes the two pre-registered metrics that decide between them.

Metric 1 — ``feature-changing 불일치율``. Rather than matching events between
vintages one by one (a corrected date or quantity makes "the same event" two
different rows, and any matching rule for that is a judgement call), this
compares what the feature actually consumes: the per-class quantity sums inside
each trailing-year window. A date correction that stays inside its window
changes nothing and is correctly counted as agreement; one that crosses a
window boundary shows up as disagreement in two windows, which is exactly its
effect on ``ev_net_share_issuance_yoy``.

Metric 2 — identity pass rate. The share of filing positions whose
``기초 + 증가 - 감소 = 기말`` identity holds, and so produce a non-NULL feature,
under each policy. A policy that never looks ahead but blanks the whole panel
has not produced a usable candidate.

Comparison scope: an older report cannot know about events after its own
settlement date, so every comparison is cut at the older vintage's ``stlm_dt``.
