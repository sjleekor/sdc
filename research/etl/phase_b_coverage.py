"""§7.1 mart-side quality/coverage diagnostics for Phase B (B-10 Stage 2).

The other five of the seven ``*_quality``/``*_coverage`` artifacts the run
directory contract lists. ``phase_b_quality.py`` holds the two that sit
directly on raw and ask "is the source good enough to build on"; these five sit
on the B-2…B-6 marts and ask the next question — "did the mart keep enough of
that source, and does the feature actually exist on enough dates for a scan
over it to mean anything".

``receipt_value_pairing_quality``  per (bsns_year, reprt_code) over
    ``stock_metric_vintage_fact``. How many rows sourced from
    ``dart_financial_statement_raw`` were confirmed against the *same receipt's*
    XBRL value. ``phase_b.receipt_value_pairing_required=verified_same_receipt``
    with ``receipt_value_pairing_error_tolerance=0`` is frozen in
    ``horizon_scan_config.yaml``, so a nonzero ``value_mismatch_rows`` is a
    blocker rather than a warning, and ``unlinked_receipt`` sizes how much XBRL
    the lake is still missing.

``stock_metric_vintage_quality``   per (metric_code, bsns_year, reprt_code,
    fs_basis) over the same mart. Availability fallback, revision ratio, mapping fallback,
    period-end conflicts, and how many positions carry more than one captured
    vintage. §4.2 needs ``mapping_fallback_ratio``/``revision_ratio`` to exist
    before evidence grade "B" can take them into account.

``quarterly_metric_quality``       per (metric_code, bsns_year, quarter) over
    ``fin_quarterly_metric_vintage``. B-3's standalone/TTM reconstruction: how
    often the direct interim value and the cumulative difference disagree, how
    often TTM completes, and how much later TTM becomes available than the
    filing that closed it.

``feature_coverage``               per (feature, variant, market, year) over the
    two daily marts. Nonnull ratio, names per date, first/last date with a
    value, and filing age. A family card's ``effective_start``/``coverage``
    lines come from here, and ``min_names_per_date`` is what decides whether a
    date survives the scan's ``min_names`` filter at all.

``event_coverage``                 per (event_year, market, reprt_code) over
    ``fin_sue_event``. Events, SUE completeness, constant-sample share, and
    per-bucket return availability — the event-grain analogue of the above.

All five are pure SQL over registered views, so the Phase B runner materializes
them exactly the way it materializes everything else in the run directory.

Missing groups are absent rows, never zero-filled — same rule as the raw-side
pair. A year with no filings is a gap you can see, not a row of zeros.
