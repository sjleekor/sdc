"""``dim_industry_group`` — one normalisation group per ticker (N2-9).

The grouping rules live in :mod:`krx_collector.definitions.industry_groups`, a
pure-data module the marts import the same way they import ``metric_rules``.
They are not reimplemented in SQL, because the fold-up is *data-dependent*: a
2-digit KSIC group with fewer than 20 members folds into its section, and a
section still short of 20 folds into ``OTHER``. That loop needs the membership
counts, so it runs in Python and its answer is handed to DuckDB as a lookup.

Two limits, both deliberate and both the reason this is diagnostic-only.

**It is not point-in-time.** ``induty_code`` comes from ``company.json``, which
reports today's industry with no change history. A company that switched
business lines carries its current industry backwards. That is a look-ahead,
which is why `11_feature_taxonomy.md` §6.3 confines industry to a normalisation
group and a diagnostic axis rather than an alpha feature.

**Groups are resolved once, not per date.** ``resolve_groups`` is documented as
a per-date call because membership moves with listings, and a per-date
resolution would be the right thing for a feature. For a diagnostic sitting on
a non-PIT input it would add cost and a moving group label without removing the
look-ahead that already dominates, so the whole universe is resolved together.
