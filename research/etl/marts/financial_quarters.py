"""``fin_quarterly_metric_vintage`` — Phase B B-3 (04_specific_plan_B.md §3.7, B-3).

Turns ``stock_metric_vintage_fact`` (B-2) instant/cumulative raw filing values
into a PIT-consistent standalone-quarter and TTM history, per metric "kind":

    direct_interim      revenue, net_income, ... — an interim (Q1/half/Q3)
                         IS/CIS filing's own ``thstrm_amount`` is *already* the
                         direct 3-month value for that quarter (OpenDART
                         convention); only Q4 needs computing, as the annual
                         filing's total minus the three known interim quarters.
    cumulative_reported  operating_cash_flow, ... — a CF filing's
                         ``thstrm_amount`` is the *cumulative* year-to-date
                         value regardless of quarter; every quarter here is a
                         sequential difference of two adjacent cumulative
                         filings.
    instant              total_assets, issued_shares, ... — a period-end
                         balance, passed through unchanged (no differencing).
    weighted_share       weighted_avg_shares, diluted_shares — a cumulative
                         time-weighted average, reconstructed via §3.7's
                         ``n * cumulative_average - (n-1) * prior_cumulative_average``
                         algebra rather than simple differencing.

Grain: ``(ticker, metric_code, fs_basis, bsns_year, quarter)``.

Point-in-time / multi-vintage scope (§1.1 condition 3, honest limitation):
    When B-1's real backfill eventually produces more than one vintage for the
    same (ticker, metric_code, fs_basis, bsns_year, reprt_code) position, this
    mart picks exactly one "primary" vintage per position — the earliest
    non-revision vintage, or the earliest known vintage if none is confirmed
    original — rather than generating the full combinatorial set of "effective
    rows" the plan's completion criterion describes. There is no real
    multi-vintage data yet to validate a fuller temporal join against; this is
    the same honest deferral B-2 makes for ``complete_original_and_revisions``.
    The dominant single-vintage case (today's raw) is unaffected either way.
