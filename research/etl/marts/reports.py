"""Coverage / readiness / freshness checks on the lake (refactor §4).

These move the Postgres operational gates onto the parquet/DuckDB compute node:

- :func:`coverage_report` / :func:`readiness_report` — ports of
  ``service/report_common_feature_coverage.py`` and ``report_common_feature_readiness.py``,
  computed over the ``common_feature_daily_fact`` mart and the KRX feature-date
  calendar instead of the dropped canonical table.
- :func:`freshness_violations` — raw-observation freshness gate, run on the lake
  (``common_feature_observation_raw`` + ``common_feature_series``) so the compute
  pipeline can refuse to run on stale raw (decision 6). It does not check source
  run age because remote ``ingestion_runs`` is not part of the raw mirror.

All functions take a DuckDB connection with the needed views already registered
and return plain dataclasses the orchestrator turns into a non-zero exit + stderr
summary (no Postgres writes).
