"""make_label — the single, parameterized label generator (00_shared §3.1).

Model count == label count, so there is ONE generator. The 20d excess-return
rank (etl_00 §2) is just the ``horizon=20, kind="excess", bench="eqw_market",
outputs=("reg","rank","cls")`` instance; 5d/60d and volatility/MDD are other
parameter sets sharing this code.

Mechanics (etl_00 §2):
  - Forward return uses a per-ticker trading-day index that EXCLUDES halt days
    (``open=high=low=0``), so ``t+H`` is exactly H real sessions later and halt/
    holiday gaps are absorbed (etl_00 §2.1; §9 checklist "거래일 인덱스 기준").
  - Benchmark (``eqw_market``): equal-weighted mean forward return within the
    same ``(trade_date, market)`` — robust, PIT-safe, no external index needed.
    ``excess = fwd - bench``; per (date, market) the mean excess is ~0.
    ``bench="index"`` is reserved for a future market-index swap (one-line, the
    prediction-target doc §1 note) and currently raises NotImplementedError.
  - Outputs (etl_00 §2.2): per-date winsorized regression (``y_reg_*``), per-date
    percentile rank in [0,1] (``y_rank_*`` — the main target), and a 3-class
    label (``y_cls_*`` ∈ {-1,0,1}) thresholded at the 0.2/0.8 ranks.
  - Auxiliary (etl_00 §2.3): realized volatility / max-drawdown of the t+1..t+H
    daily-return path, produced by :func:`build_risk_label_sql`.

All ranking/winsorizing is WITHIN ``(trade_date, market)`` so regime/market-
direction is removed and the label matches per-date cross-sectional features
(etl_00 §2.2, §4.3).

See ``etl_00`` §2, ``00_shared`` §3.1, and ``etl_03_implementation_plan.md`` §4 (P4).
