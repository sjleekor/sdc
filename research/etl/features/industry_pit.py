"""``dim_industry_pit_daily`` — point-in-time industry classification (F-1.5).

Design: ``docs/dev/20260907_additional_feature/01_industry_pit.md`` §2.3.

``dart_corp_master.induty_code`` is an UPSERT target, so it holds *today's* KSIC
code with no history: every industry-neutral variant built on it puts a 2026
classification into a 2015 z-score. ``dart_corp_profile_history`` (F-1.1~F-1.4)
fixes that going forwards by snapshotting ``company.json`` once a month, and this
mart is what turns those monthly snapshots into a daily as-of dimension.

It does **not** fix the past, and it does not pretend to. Sessions before the
first snapshot carry the earliest observed code with ``ind_is_backcast = TRUE``,
which is the look-ahead marker ``01`` §2.3 requires: a consumer decides what to
do with those rows, and both the Horizon Scan families and the model's FS3 treat
them as NULL until D-F1 is decided (``01`` §4).

**Exposure rule — one session later than ``01`` §2.3's ``<= t``.** That section
says "the last ``induty_code`` observed at or before session t". Taken
literally that is unsafe: the seed rows were observed at 23:10 KST and the
2026-09 snapshot at 00:14 KST, so "observed on date t" can mean either before
or after session t's close depending on when the Cronicle event happened to
run. This mart therefore exposes an observation from the **next valid session
strictly after** ``date(observed_at)``, which is the repo-wide rule for a
domestic observation (``00_overview.md`` §4.3) and holds whatever time of day
the monthly run lands on. The cost is one session of delay on a value that
changes a few times a year.

**Fold-up universe.** ``ind_group`` comes from
:func:`krx_collector.definitions.industry_groups.resolve_groups` — the rule
fixed in N2-6 (2-digit KSIC prefix, fold into the section below
``MIN_GROUP_SIZE`` members, then into ``OTHER``), reused rather than
reselected (``01`` §7). It is resolved **once per ``observed_month``**, over
every ticker-bearing corporation in that month's snapshot, including the
delisted ones (``corp_cls = 'E'``). Two consequences worth stating:

- Counting delisted names means a group can clear ``MIN_GROUP_SIZE`` on names
  that no longer trade. Restricting the count to live names was tried and
  rejected: the label map would then be resolved on the 2026 listed universe
  and applied to 2015 sessions, which sends most of the historical panel to
  ``OTHER`` — a worse distortion than the one it removes, and one that lands
  hardest exactly on the delisted cohort F-9.3 showed we cannot backfill.
- A consumer that needs a group whose members are all live re-resolves on its
  own universe; ``resolve_groups`` is a pure function and takes any mapping.

**Change flags.** ``ind_changed_recent_252`` is NULL, not FALSE, until two
*consecutive non-seed* observations have been exposed. The seed rows are
copies of ``dart_corp_master``'s current state, so a difference between the seed
and the first real snapshot may have happened at any time before it (the DDL
comment on ``dart_corp_profile_history.is_seed`` says the same) — dating such a
change to the snapshot that first saw it would be a fabrication, and F-1.4
measured one of the two differences in the first pair to be a *precision*
change (262 -> 26293), not an industry change at all. So a transition is only
counted between two non-seed observations, and "not enough observations to
tell" reads as NULL. The first month this flag can be non-NULL is 2026-11 —
2026-10's snapshot is the first whose predecessor is itself not a seed.

Once it *is* measurable it stays measurable: the guard is a cumulative count,
not a windowed one, so a month with no new observation reads FALSE ("no change
was observed") rather than falling back to NULL.

``ind_group_changed_recent_252`` applies the same rule to ``ind_group``. It is
additive to ``01`` §2.3's five columns because the D-F1 threshold (0.3%,
``01`` §4.2) is stated on the *group* rate, and because the group comparison is
what discriminates a real industry move from the precision artifact above.

**Grain** ``(trade_date, ticker, market)``, valid sessions only — halt rows
(``open=high=low=0``) never enter, exactly as in ``build_valid_session_sql``.
