"""feat_event — sparse corporate-action flags (etl_00 §3.4, selective / 2nd-pass).

Source: ``dart_share_count_raw`` (issued/treasury shares). The DART event tables
are non-standard (``se``/``stock_knd`` free-text, ~50-139 variants) and not yet
normalized (etl_00 §3.4), so the 1st pass uses ONLY robust low-frequency flags
anchored on the ``se = '합계'`` (total) rows:

  - ev_treasury_ratio        : treasury shares / issued shares (buyback intensity)
  - ev_has_treasury          : treasury shares > 0 flag
  - ev_shares_chg_yoy        : YoY change in issued shares (dilution / buyback)

PIT lag: filings are annual (``bsns_year``); we make a row available at
``bsns_year-end + 90 days`` (same conservative lag as financials, etl_00 §3.3),
then interval-join to the universe so every (t, ticker) gets the latest available
year's flags. ``ev_`` prefix. NULL before first availability -> ``*_isna`` (P5).

Dividend features are deferred: ``dart_shareholder_return_raw`` needs the se/
stock_knd canonical mapping (etl_00 §3.4) before its values are trustworthy.

See ``etl_00`` §3.4, ``etl_03_implementation_plan.md`` §4 (P8).
