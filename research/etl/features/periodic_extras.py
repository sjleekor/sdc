"""Daily PIT features from OpenDART periodic employee/governance responses (N6).

The DS002 endpoints expose final-vintage values.  Every feature therefore starts
only after the retained receipt becomes public; annual values are never backdated
to the business-year end.  Growth/change values use the later of the current and
previous receipt, and productivity also waits for the annual revenue vintage.
