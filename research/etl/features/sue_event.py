"""``fin_sue_event`` — Phase B B-6 (04_specific_plan_B.md §4.6, §5.2, B-6).

Grain: ``(ticker, original_rcept_no, event_formation_date, market)`` — one row
per *original* earnings-announcement event, not per calendar day (§5.2). This
is the one Phase B mart that is event-time, not daily-continuous: every other
B-3..B-5 mart broadcasts a PIT value across every trading day until the next
one supersedes it; this mart instead measures the market's reaction to one
specific announcement over a fixed 60-session window after it.

Built entirely from B-2/B-3 outputs plus ``daily_ohlcv`` — no new raw
extraction:

    original-event determination   B-2's ``captured_vintage_status``/
                                     ``is_revision`` (already receipt-relation-
                                     based, §3.5) — an event only exists here
                                     when B-2 could actually confirm it, never
                                     from a bare captured rcept_no (§3.5: "raw에
                                     우연히 남은 최소 rcept_no를 original로
                                     간주하지 않는다").
    same-day revision collapse      B-2's ``same_day_effective_rcept_no``.
    event_formation_date            B-2's ``available_from`` for that vintage
                                     (already "next KRX session after
                                     disclosure").
    quarterly EPS / comparative EPS B-3's standalone ``controlling_net_income``
                                     and ``weighted_avg_shares``, plus B-3's
                                     ``value_lag_4q`` for both.

Comparative EPS — a deliberate scope reduction (see also ``metric_vintages.py``
and ``event_scan.py`` docstrings for the same honesty pattern): §4.6's
*primary* method reconstructs comparative weighted-average shares from a
separate "prior-year" XBRL duration context inside the *same* filing. This
repository does not parse multiple XBRL contexts per concept per filing (B-2
takes one captured value per concept), so that reconstruction is not
buildable without new XBRL-parsing work. This module instead always uses what
§4.6 itself defines as the secondary ``as_was_comparative`` method — both the
net income and the shares exactly as they were reported 4 quarters ago (B-3's
``value_lag_4q``) — labeled ``comparative_policy='as_was_lag4q'`` in the
output so nothing claims to be the primary frmtrm_q_amount-based figure it
is not.

Market-excess convention matches ``research/etl/labels.py``'s ``eqw_market``
benchmark (equal-weighted mean of the same window's return across every
ticker with a valid session that day) — reimplemented here rather than
imported, consistent with every other Phase B mart's independence from
non-Phase-B modules.

The 60-session revision-contamination check (event rule 5) compares *session
index* distance, not calendar-day distance: a later vintage's own
``available_from`` (already next-session-adjusted by B-2) is looked up in the
same per-ticker session index used for returns, so "60 sessions" means
exactly 60 trading sessions regardless of holidays in between.
