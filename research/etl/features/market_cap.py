"""``feat_market_cap`` — size from the exchange's own share count (`mcap_krx_log`).

The existing size feature is `fin_log_mcap` in `fin_scan`, built as
`close_d x issued_raw` where `issued_raw` is DART's issued-share count. That
pairs a price which reflects a corporate action immediately with a share count
that does not move until the next periodic report is **disclosed** — months, not
days. Nothing gates it: `base_ok` checks availability and validity, and
`shares_age_days` is computed in `stock_pit` and never read.

`daily_market_cap.listed_shares` is the exchange's number and changes on the
**listing** date. That collapses the mismatch from months to about three weeks
and removes the disclosure-lag error class entirely — the reason N1 was collected.

Because the definition changes, this lands on a **new id** rather than moving
`fin_log_mcap` (N1-7 decision 1: frozen ids keep their definition, new
definitions get new ids). `fin_log_mcap` stays as published, with its lag
recorded as a limitation.

The residual three-week window is **masked, not corrected** — see
`research.etl.corporate_actions` for what the window is and
`poc/n1_validation.md` §5.5 for why estimating the ratio was rejected. The raw
value is still emitted as `mcap_krx` so the masking can be audited; only the
modelling column `mcap_krx_log` goes NULL.
