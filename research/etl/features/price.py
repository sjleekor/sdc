"""feat_price — derived price/momentum/volatility/liquidity features (etl_00 §3.1).

Source: ``daily_ohlcv`` only (always available). Produces *pre-standardization*
columns at grain ``(trade_date, ticker, market)`` with the ``px_`` prefix. Level
prices are deliberately turned into returns/ratios (etl_00 §3.1, L3/L5); winsor/
log/z-score is the model preprocess step (P5), not here.

Windows use trading-row counts (``ROWS BETWEEN n PRECEDING``) over the per-ticker
ordering, which absorbs halts/holidays consistently with the d_idx label logic.
Halt days (``open=high=low=0``) carry a stale close, so returns spanning a halt
are slightly distorted — flagged via ``px_is_halted`` / ``px_halt_ratio_20d`` so
the model preprocess can mask them (etl_00 §3.1, §1.2).

Conventions (etl_01 §3): all price arithmetic casts BIGINT prices to DOUBLE
before division/log to avoid integer truncation and Decimal overflow.

See ``etl_00`` §3.1 and ``etl_03_implementation_plan.md`` §4 (P3).
