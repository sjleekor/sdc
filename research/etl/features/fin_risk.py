"""``feat_fin_risk`` — leverage, life cycle and state transitions (F-4).

Design: ``docs/dev/20260907_additional_feature/03_financial_risk_lifecycle_transition.md``.

Nine families over the canonical metrics that were already collected, so this
mart adds no ingestion at all:

    leverage / risk   fin_debt_to_assets, fin_net_debt_to_mcap,
                      fin_interest_coverage, fin_ext_finance_to_assets
    life cycle        fin_lifecycle_stage, fin_lifecycle_transition
    transition        fin_profit_turn, fin_dividend_initiation,
                      fin_negative_equity_exit

**PIT rule.** Same strict vintage as ``feat_fin_scan_daily``, imported from
``fin_vintage`` rather than restated (F-4.1): a figure is readable from the
session after its filing was received, TTM for flow metrics and the instant
itself for balance-sheet ones, one interval per availability date with same-day
candidates resolved to the latest fiscal period, and a *single* ``fs_basis``
decision per ticker-date — CFS if ``net_income`` has a consolidated value that
day, else OFS — applied to every metric, so a day's bundle can never mix
consolidated and separate figures. ``fin_dividend_initiation`` is the one
column not read from the vintage: DPS comes from
``dart_shareholder_return_raw`` and is exposed on the session *after* the
annual filing's receipt date, the rule ``ev_payout_yield`` uses.

**Valid from.** TTM needs four consecutive quarters and the three transition
families need a *preceding* vintage on top of that, so nothing is populated
before roughly 2016-2017 — the measured start per column is in
``docs/dev/20260907_additional_feature/results/``.

**"Previous vintage" is per metric.** CFO/CFI/CFF each have their own interval
chain, so a stage transition compares this filing's triple with each metric's
own preceding value. Those three preceding values come from the same filing
almost always but not by construction, so ``fin_lifecycle_prev_aligned`` says
whether they did — the limitation is reported, not hidden.

**Survivorship.** ~1,300 delisted corporations have no financials yet (S-1
remainder, ``06`` §3). Decline-stage and distress conclusions are held until
that backfill lands; the mart is built now and the card carries
"생존편향 미해결".

**Grain** ``(trade_date, ticker, market)``, one row per ``dim_stock_pit_daily``
row — the same layering as ``feat_fin_scan_daily``, with broad/tradable
filtering left downstream.

#: Same role as ``FIN_FEATURE_FORMULA_VERSION``: the ratio definitions, the
#: life-cycle mapping, the transition rules and the interest-coverage clip are
#: covered by neither ``config_hash`` (the scan YAML) nor ``phase_b_code_hash``
#: (the analysis modules), so a change here would otherwise produce different
#: numbers under an identical run-spec fingerprint. Bump it whenever any of
#: them changes, and do not reuse an artifact of the same snapshot across a bump.
#:
#:   fin_risk_v1 — the 2026-09 rules as first built (03 §1).
#:   fin_risk_v2 — F-5.0. No formula changed here; the *inputs* did.
#:            interest_paid, investing_cash_flow, financing_cash_flow and
#:            cash_and_cash_equivalents gained XBRL fallback mapping rules, and
#:            the `ifrs_` spelling those rules add is what covers 2015-2018
#:            (DART switched taxonomy prefix around 2019: 364 facts up to 2018
#:            under ifrs-full_Liabilities against 112,827 under
#:            ifrs_Liabilities). Five of the nine families were confined to
#:            2020+ purely by that gap. The values move for every one of them,
#:            so the fingerprint has to move too — a re-run under fin_risk_v1
#:            would otherwise reuse an artifact of an identical run spec while
#:            producing different numbers.
