"""feat_flow — investor-flow / short-selling features (etl_00 §3.2).

Source: ``krx_security_flow_raw`` (the heaviest table, 76M rows). Pipeline:

  1. KRX-first dedup. KRX/PYKRX carry the same natural key with zero value
     conflicts (etl_00 §3.2). ``QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() ... ORDER BY (KRX first)``
     keeps the KRX row. Result = 55,918,702 distinct rows (etl_01 §4.2, pinned
     as a regression guard in tests). NOTE: requires the view be read with
     ``hive_partitioning=false`` so the real ``source`` column survives
     (etl_01 §4.2) — the lake reader enforces this.
  2. Wide pivot the 7 metric_codes to one row per (trade_date, ticker, market).
  3. Derive cumulative / change / z-score features (``flow_`` prefix). Net-buy
     volumes are accumulated and z-scored (not used as raw share counts).

Short-vs-volume ratios (``short_selling_volume / daily volume``, etc.) need the
daily traded ``volume``/``turnover`` which live in ``daily_ohlcv``, not here, so
they are computed at panel assembly (P5) where price and flow are joined. This
builder passes through ``flow_short_selling_volume`` / ``flow_short_selling_value``
for that step and keeps only flow-internal derivations.

Coverage asymmetry: ``short_selling_balance_quantity`` starts 2016-06-30 (others
2007-06-05), so balance-derived features are NULL before then -> the preprocess
stage adds ``*_isna`` flags (etl_00 §3.2, L1). The 3-investor net-buy sum is NOT
an identity (excludes 기타법인) so we never derive a "closes-to-zero" feature
from it (etl_00 §3.2).

See ``etl_00`` §3.2 and ``etl_03_implementation_plan.md`` §4 (P3).
