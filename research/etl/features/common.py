"""feat_common — market/macro common features, PIT broadcast (etl_00 §3.5).

Source: ``common_feature_daily_fact`` (canonical lake). These are stock-agnostic
market/macro series (indices, breadth, rates, FX, commodities, macro) that get
broadcast to every name on a given ``feature_date`` (etl_00 §3.5). PIT is already
guaranteed by the table's ``asof_available_date`` (look-ahead violations = 0,
verified), and we additionally filter ``asof_available_date <= t`` so only rows
known by ``t`` are used.

Grain after pivot: one row per ``feature_date`` (= trade_date ``t``); the panel
join broadcasts it across all tickers on that date (etl_00 §4.1). ``cf_`` prefix.

Coverage caveat (etl_00 §1.1, §3.5): the daily history starts 2025-12-15, so for
the 2015+ training panel this is mostly NULL -> a *secondary* "market-regime"
feature, not a core one. The ``*_isna`` flags (P5) carry that, and the design
keeps only the join path ready for the eventual long backfill (3rd milestone).

See ``etl_00`` §3.5, ``etl_03_implementation_plan.md`` §4 (P8).
