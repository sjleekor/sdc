"""dim_regime_daily — market regime binaries on the KRX session grid.

Design: ``docs/dev/20260907_model_experiment/02_features_and_preprocessing.md``
§1.4, §3.1. The definitions are Phase C's (``docs/dev/20260829_macro_features/
01_design/03_stage1b_conditional_ic_phase_c.md`` §2.3) and are **not** restated
here — this module imports
:mod:`research.analysis.horizon_scan_phase_c_regimes` and renames its output.
Two implementations of "was the VIX high that day" would be two regimes, and the
model's FS2 comparison only means something if it conditions on the same
partition Phase C measured the interactions on.

Grain ``(trade_date)``: one row per KRX session, broadcast across every name at
panel-join time. Each regime contributes two columns:

  ``rg_<id>``    the binary the model reads (``z > 0``)
  ``rg_<id>_z``  the continuous score behind it, for diagnostics

The four primary regimes (``vix_up``, ``vix_high``, ``market_up``, ``liq_high``)
are FS2 inputs; the three exploratory ones ride along in the mart and are not
put into a feature set (`02` §1.4).

Warm-up is a NULL, not a zero (`02` §3.1). Two different things have to be
full, and only one of them is Phase C's business:

  * the *session* window — Phase C emits NULL until ``session_idx`` reaches the
    regime's window, and this lake's session grid starts in 2007;
  * the *observation* window — ``common_feature_daily_fact``'s daily series
    start 2014-06-16, and a 252-session median taken over three observations is
    not a 252-session median. Phase C's own CLI handles this by trimming to
    ``--sample-start 2015-06-16``; a mart cannot trim, so it NULLs instead.

Hence ``REGIME_VALID_FROM``: every regime column is NULL before it, which is
what the panel's ``*_isna`` flags then carry. Without it the mart would hand the
model a ``rg_vix_high = false`` for 2014-07 that came from a window holding a
handful of values — a regime that flipped because its window was short, which is
the artefact Phase C's module docstring exists to prevent.

Phase C's alternative cut (``alt_s_*``) and its ``session_idx`` are deliberately
dropped: the alternative is a diagnostic for the scan, and a second session
index in the panel would shadow the one ``dim_price_quality_daily`` supplies.
