"""``dim_peer_monthly`` / ``feat_relation_stat`` — statistical peer relations (F-2).

Design: ``docs/dev/20260907_additional_feature/02_relationship_features.md`` §1.

The cross-section had no relation axis at all (``11_feature_taxonomy.md`` §7,
C5 = 0). Industry is the obvious grouping and it is the one we cannot have
point-in-time — ``induty_code`` carries today's industry backwards with no
change history (F-1 starts that versioning, and only from 2026-09 forwards).
So the peer set here is built from returns instead: structurally PIT,
available over the whole 2015- sample, and needing no new collection.

**Peer set** (§1.1). At each month end ``t0`` the correlation of market-model
*residual* returns is measured over the trailing 252 sessions, and the top
``PEER_K`` = 20 names become that stock's peers for every session from
``t0 + 1`` through the next month end. Residuals, not raw returns: raw-return
correlation is dominated by the market factor, which would make every stock a
peer of every other. The residual is
``trading_panel.build_market_model_sql``'s — the same one ``feat_price``'s
``px_idio_vol_60d`` / ``px_resid_mom_12_1`` and ``feat_macro_exposure``'s betas
are statements about, reused rather than redefined (F-2.1; ``feat_price``'s SQL
text is an A0 cache key and is untouched by this module).

**PIT rule.** Everything a session-``t`` row reads was published before
session ``t``:

- the peer set comes from a month end strictly before ``t``, chosen from
  returns through that month end only;
- the big-cap subset is ranked on the last ``daily_market_cap`` row strictly
  *before* ``t0``. That endpoint publishes T+1 (``CLAUDE.md``, "KRX 접근 제한"),
  so a session's own market cap is not readable until the next evening; taking
  the row before ``t0`` means the ranking was known by ``t0``'s close, hence
  before the first session the peer set is used on;
- ``rel_peer_bigcap_lag_ret_5d`` reads sessions ``t-5 .. t-1`` (Hou 2007's
  lead-lag is a claim about *yesterday's* large caps); every other column reads
  a window ending at ``t``.

**Valid from.** ``resid_ret`` needs 252 prior sessions before it exists at all,
the correlation window needs 252 sessions of it, and the peer 60-session return
needs 60 more — so the first populated session is roughly 252 + 252 sessions
after ``daily_ohlcv`` starts (2014-01). The measured effective start per column
is recorded in ``docs/dev/20260907_additional_feature/results/``.

**Grain** ``(trade_date, ticker, market)``, valid sessions only — halt rows
(``open=high=low=0``) never enter, exactly as in ``build_valid_session_sql``.

The diagnostic columns (``_k10`` / ``_k40`` / ``rel_peer_ksic_agree`` /
``rel_peer_corr_mean``) exist to be reported on, not preregistered. K is fixed
at 20 and the alternatives are never promoted — publishing both says how
sensitive the answer is to K, it does not license picking the best one after
seeing the result (§1.2, "K는 사전등록값이고 바꾸지 않는다").
