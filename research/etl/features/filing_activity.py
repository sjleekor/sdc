"""feat_filing_activity — disclosure-activity features from receipts already held (N5-7).

Source: ``dart_filing_receipt_raw``, 1,201,866 rows over 2015-01 .. 2026-08 for
2,657 tickers. **Nothing new is collected here.** The table has been in the
pipeline since Phase B and is used only for ``fin_sue_event`` and for quality
diagnostics; not one alpha feature reads it.

This is what replaced the ``elestock`` collection plan (N5-6). The DS004
ownership APIs answer with a rolling two-year window — even Samsung Electronics,
listed in 1975, starts at 2024-08-26 — and take ``corp_code`` as their only
argument, so there is no year loop that reaches further back. The receipts carry
the same events over **10.5 years** at 98.1% coverage. The trade is quantity for
frequency: the collected path could have given holdings changes, this one gives
filing counts. A ten-year sample of a weaker measure beats a one-year sample of
a stronger one.

Two definitions are shared rather than re-derived, because a second definition
of the same concept is worse than either one:

* amendment markers come from :mod:`research.etl.phase_b_quality`, which already
  computes ``revision_ratio`` from them for Phase B source quality.
* the trading calendar is the universe panel's own ``trade_date`` set, so
  windows count sessions the way every other feature family counts them.

PIT: a receipt filed on day D is exposed on the **next trading day**, never on
D itself. DART publishes through the day, and same-day exposure would let an
evening filing predict that afternoon's return.

``ev_material_event_flag`` (`09` §3) is deliberately absent. It needs a
materiality list — which ``report_nm`` values count as material — and that
choice is not made yet. Adding it with a provisional list would put an
unregistered judgement inside a pre-registered bundle.
