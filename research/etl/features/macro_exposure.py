"""feat_macro_exposure — per-ticker rolling macro exposure betas (Stage 1a).

Design: ``docs/dev/20260829_macro_features/01_design/02_stage1a_exposure_beta_families.md``.

Grain ``(trade_date, ticker, market)``, valid sessions only — the same three
key columns ``feat_price`` emits and nothing else shared, so the Phase B panel
can LEFT JOIN this in without shadowing a column it already has (the panel's
``valid_session_idx`` comes from ``dim_price_quality_daily``; a second one here
would be silently renamed rather than rejected). Six primary columns, each a
rolling slope of one stock's return on one macro factor:

    macro_beta_usdkrw / _wti / _kr10y / _sp500_lag / _vix   +   px_market_beta

Two things decide the shape of this mart.

**Residual, not raw.** The scan's label is an excess return over the
per-(date, market) equal-weighted mean — market-*average* neutral, not
market-*beta* neutral. A raw-return factor beta satisfies
``Cov(r_i, f) = beta_i,m * Cov(r_m, f) + Cov(e_i, f)``, so for a factor that
co-moves with the market (the won especially) it largely reproduces
``px_market_beta``. The primary columns therefore regress the market-model
residual; the raw-return version is kept beside it as ``macro_rawbeta_*``, and
the difference between the two is the diagnostic (§4).

**Two factor timings, so two windows.** Domestic series reach the fact one
session late (``next_krx_session``: the row on session t carries the t-1
observation), while foreign series are the previous New York close, already
known on the morning of session t (``same_krx_session_morning``). So a
domestic factor's same-session change ``g_tau`` is only complete on session
tau+1, and its beta on session t may use pairs up to tau <= t-1 — window B,
ending one session back. Foreign factors pair directly with the same session's
return — window A, through the current session. Neither window can see a value
that was not published yet. See §2.2/§2.3.

A factor is NULL for a session whose source observation did not update
(``asof_available_date`` unchanged): a stale carry-forward is not a zero
change, and ``global_sp500_ret_1d`` — used as-is — would otherwise contribute
the same return twice. ``REGR_*`` drops NULL pairs on its own.

    are placed on session tau as the change that completes on tau+1, which is

    for oil: WTI spot settled at -36.98 on 2020-04-20, which reaches the fact
    on the 2020-04-21 KRX session, so ``f_wti`` is undefined on that session
