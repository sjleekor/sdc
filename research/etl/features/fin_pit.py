"""feat_fin_pit — point-in-time financial features (etl_00 §3.3, etl_01 §6).

Source: ``stock_metric_fact`` (canonical lake). Financials carry no disclosure
date, so a conservative PIT lag stands in for it (etl_00 §3.3):

    available_from := period_end + 90d   (annual reports)
                      period_end + 45d   (quarterly: q1/half/q3)

A feature row at trade_date ``t`` may only use reports with
``available_from <= t`` (no look-ahead). For each (ticker, metric_code) we build
disclosure *intervals* ``[available_from, next_available_from)`` and join the
universe by interval — this preserves ALL ~26 metric_codes per name (a naive
``ASOF JOIN`` returns only one right row per left row and would drop 25 metrics;
etl_01 §6 verified: Samsung 2024-06-03 -> 26 rows). When two reports map to the
same available_from we keep the latest ``period_end`` (restatement-safe).

The wide metrics are turned into ratios/growth (level amounts are not used
directly, L3/L5, etl_00 §3.3): roa, debt_to_equity, equity_ratio, ocf_to_assets,
cash_ratio. Capital impairment (``total_equity <= 0``, ~12 names) flips ratios,
so a ``fin_is_negative_equity`` flag is set and the affected ratio is clipped.
``fin_has_fs`` marks names with any balance-sheet metric (vs SC/SR-only corps).

Output grain: (trade_date, ticker, market), ``fin_`` prefix. NULL where no report
is yet available at ``t`` (early history / warm-up) -> ``*_isna`` flags in P5.

See ``etl_00`` §3.3, ``etl_01`` §6, ``etl_03_implementation_plan.md`` §4 (P7).
