"""``feat_event_scan_daily`` — Phase B B-5 (04_specific_plan_B.md §4.4-§4.5, B-5).

Two independent PIT continuous features, both interval-joined onto the daily
panel the same way as B-4:

    ev_net_share_issuance_yoy   §4.4 — economic net new shares over the
                                 trailing year, using ``dart_capital_change_raw``
                                 (B-PR2) to separate economic issuance (paid-in
                                 capital increases, conversions, option
                                 exercises) from mechanical actions (splits,
                                 bonus issues, stock dividends) that a naive
                                 share-count YoY would misread as issuance.
    ev_payout_yield             §4.5 — (cash dividends + buyback cash) / market
                                 cap, cash dividends preferring a direct total
                                 amount row and falling back to a DPS x
                                 eligible-shares proxy, buyback reusing B-3's
                                 already-TTM'd ``treasury_share_acquisition_amount``.

Why this reads ``dart_share_count_raw``/``dart_shareholder_return_raw`` directly
rather than through B-2/B-3: ``now_to_isu_stock_totqy``/``now_to_dcrs_stock_totqy``
(cumulative-since-listing issuance/decrease totals, used for the identity
check) and the dividend *total* row are not covered by any
``metric_rules.py`` rule, and adding one would touch the shared file B-2/B-3
deliberately avoid (its legacy consumer is frozen against golden-parity
fixtures — see ``metric_vintages.py``'s module docstring). ``dps`` and
``treasury_share_acquisition_amount`` *are* already metric_rules.py-covered,
so those two are read from ``stock_metric_vintage_fact``/
``fin_quarterly_metric_vintage`` instead of re-deriving them.

Identity reconciliation uses only the numeric share-count fields
(``istc_totqy``, ``now_to_isu_stock_totqy``, ``now_to_dcrs_stock_totqy``); the
free-text reason columns (``redc``, ``profit_incnr``, ``rdmstk_repy``, ``etc``)
are never parsed for a reason (§3.4/§4.4: "이 source에 없는 증가 사유를
추정하지 않는다") — they are not read by this module at all.

Dividend row-name matching (best-effort, see ``CASH_DIVIDEND_TOTAL_ROW_NAME``):
this repository has never captured a live OpenDART alotMatter payload with a
total cash-dividend-amount row, so the row_name below is an unverified best
guess. If it never matches, the code does exactly what §4.5 prescribes when
the direct total is unavailable: falls back to the DPS proxy — it does not
silently produce a wrong number.
