"""§9 B-9's "source 비치명 경고" — the grade-A cap from source-layer quality.

``08_phase_b_implementation_log.md`` §4.2 left this open with an explicit
reason: the three signals the plan names (``mapping_fallback_ratio``,
``revision_ratio``, segment diagnostics) had no computed values anywhere, and
``compute_phase_b_evidence_grade``'s docstring says to wire them in "once they
exist rather than fabricating a warning signal that doesn't exist yet". B-10
Stage 2 produced the first two on 2026-08-12, so this module connects them.

What it does *not* do: turn a source warning into a failure. These are
non-fatal — a family that trips one is still a discovery, it just cannot claim
the strongest grade. Nothing here can move a cell below B.

**Thresholds are pre-registered in ``04_specific_plan_B.md`` §2.5 and fixed
before the first Phase B run that will be judged by them.** They were chosen
from the meaning of each ratio, not from the per-family numbers — see the plan
section for the reasoning and for an honest note on what was already measured
when they were written.

Unmeasurable is not the same as clean. A ratio that cannot be computed —
``revision_ratio`` before any receipt history exists, for instance — caps the
grade exactly as a breached threshold does. Grade A is the strongest claim in
this pipeline, and "we could not check a known risk" is not a basis for it.
