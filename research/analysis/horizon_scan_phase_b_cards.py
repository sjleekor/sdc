"""§7.1 ``family_summary.parquet`` / ``family_cards.md`` — B-10 Stage 4.

One row and one card per Phase B family (8 today), collapsing everything the
run already computed — the readiness freeze, the assembled primary table, the
Stage 2 coverage diagnostics, the rank-correlation pairs — into the per-family
conclusion §6 B-10 specifies.

Two rules shape the whole module:

**A blocked family is the normal case, not an error path.** Every Phase B cell
is ``blocked_exploratory`` until the new raw lands, so the card's job right now
is to name the missing dependency and nothing else. Statistics fields stay
``None`` rather than 0/False — "not evaluated" and "evaluated, found nothing"
are different facts and a card that conflates them is worse than no card.

**Nothing is recomputed here.** Every number is read off a row some earlier
stage already produced, so a card can never disagree with the artifact it
summarizes. The only derived values are aggregations over a family's own cells
(best grade, min q, union of failed gates) and the ``next_step`` sentence.
