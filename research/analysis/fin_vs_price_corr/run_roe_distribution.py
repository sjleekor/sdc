"""ROE distribution analysis for the financial PIT mart (plan 01_00_roe_distribution).

Recomputes ``stock_metric_fact`` from the raw lake with the current (CIS-aware)
normalization rules, rebuilds ``feat_fin_pit``, then profiles ``fin_roe`` along
the axes of plan ``01_00_roe_distribution_plan.md`` §5:

    5.1 overall distribution (month-end panel + company-latest samples)
    5.2 time-varying cross-sectional distribution
    5.3 company-level ROE level / volatility / value-change profile
    5.4 rank persistence (12m calendar lag + filing-to-filing value-change)
    5.5 market (KOSPI/KOSDAQ) distribution
    5.7 outliers / data-quality cases
    (5.6 sector analysis is out of scope: no sector mapping in this snapshot)

Outputs CSV tables + 3 PNG figures + analysis_summary.md under
``reports/analysis/fin_vs_price_corr/<report-date>/roe_distribution/``.

Sampling principles (plan §4): the daily mart repeats the same filing across many
trade days, so distribution work uses a *month-end panel* (last trade day per
ticker/market/month) and a *company-latest* (last non-null-ROE row per name)
sample. ``fin_has_fs = 0`` names are excluded from the ROE distribution;
``fin_is_negative_equity = 1`` is already ROE-null in the mart (clipped).
