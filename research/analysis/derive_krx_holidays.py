"""F-9.2 — derive KRX trading holidays 2014-2023 from the raw lake.

``docs/holidays_krx.csv`` only covers 2024-2026, so for 2014-2023 the
``common_feature_daily_fact`` grid is every *weekday* — holidays included,
carrying the previous session's value. Counting ``t-20`` or ``t-252`` on that
grid therefore means a different window length either side of 2024, which is
why the regime work had to route around it on the KRX session grid
(``03_stage1b`` §2.1). The workaround works; every other consumer that rolls
the fact directly falls into the same trap.

No new collection is needed. ``daily_market_cap`` (KRX Open API, 2014-06-02-)
has **zero rows on a non-session day** — the opposite of pykrx, which returns a
whole market of price-zero rows. So a weekday absent from it is a KRX holiday.
Before 2014-06-02 the same logic runs on ``daily_ohlcv``, where a holiday is a
day *every* ticker is missing rather than one where a few are halted or
delisted.

Two guards, because "no rows" can also mean "we never collected that day":

* the derived set is cross-checked against the 2024-2026 rows the CSV already
  has, and the script fails if it does not reproduce them;
* a run of more than ``MAX_RUN_DAYS`` consecutive missing weekdays is reported
  as a suspected collection gap rather than emitted as holidays.

Example::

    uv run python -m research.analysis.derive_krx_holidays \
        --snapshot-date 2026-08-23 --source sj2_remote --write
