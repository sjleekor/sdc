"""Feature sets FS0-FS3 for model 02, fixed as column lists in code.

Plan: ``docs/dev/20260907_model_experiment/02_features_and_preprocessing.md``
§1 (the sets), §2 (PIT), §3.2 (interactions), §5 (mart mapping).

The lists live in code rather than YAML on purpose (`02` §0): a preregistered
feature set that can be edited between runs is not preregistered. Every set is
a superset of the one before it — FS0 (40) -> FS1 (56) -> FS2 (68) -> FS3 (79)
— so an E-stage comparison is always "the same columns plus these".

Two things this module does *not* do. It does not screen features: FS1's
additions are there because the univariate horizon scan passed them (T1/T2),
FS3's because F-HS-1 did, and a model is not allowed to re-decide that. And it
does not read a mart — ``COLUMN_MART`` only records where each column comes
from, so the builder (M-PR5) can register the views it needs and a test can
check the mapping is complete.
