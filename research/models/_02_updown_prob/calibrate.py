"""calibrate — map a score to a probability without touching valid data.

Plan: ``docs/dev/20260907_model_experiment/04_models_and_calibration.md`` §3.

Two rules decide everything here.

**Valid data is never fit on.** A calibrator fit on the slice it is judged on
would report a calibration the model does not have. So the fit slice is carved
out of the *train* range: its trailing ``frac`` of sessions, with the model
itself trained on what comes before, minus an ``h``-session embargo. The embargo
is not decoration — an h-session label formed on the last model-train session
resolves inside the calibration slice, and without the gap the calibrator would
be reading labels the model already saw.

**Calibration is per (horizon, model, fold).** Nothing is shared across folds:
each fold's calibrator is fit on that fold's own trailing sessions.

``isotonic`` is the plan's default because it is free to be non-monotonic in
*shape* while monotonic in order — it can pull an overconfident boosting tail
back without assuming a sigmoid. ``platt`` is kept beside it for comparison.
On L-B (positive rate 0.2) isotonic's upper steps rest on few names, which is
why the reliability table records the per-bin ``n`` rather than only the gap.
