"""selection — the between-stage rules, as code that writes ``selection.json``.

Plan: ``docs/dev/20260907_model_experiment/05_experiment_matrix.md`` §2 (each
stage's rule), `03` §3.3 (what counts as an improvement), §3.2 (the two primary
metrics).

The rules live here, not in a reader's head, because the whole matrix rests on
"the answer to stage k is fixed before stage k+1 runs". Every function below
takes the stage's run summaries and returns both the decision and the sentence
that justifies it, so ``selection.json`` explains itself and a later reader
cannot re-derive a different winner from the same numbers.

Nothing here reads a run it was not given, and no rule has a magnitude
threshold that was not preregistered: the only numbers in this file are
``E0_RANK_IC_TOLERANCE`` (`05` §2 E0) and the fold-count majority (`03` §3.3).
