"""registry — the preregistered run matrix E0-E5, fixed in code.

Plan: ``docs/dev/20260907_model_experiment/05_experiment_matrix.md`` §1 (the
stage table), §2 (each stage's runs and its selection rule).

Why the matrix is code and not a table someone reads: a stage's runs and the
rule that picks its winner both have to exist *before* the numbers do. A run
list assembled at the prompt is a search; this list is a preregistration, and
``test_updown_registry`` fails if it stops matching the document.

Later stages do not repeat the earlier stages' answers — they inherit them.
A field set to :data:`SELECTED` is filled in from the previous stage's
``selection.json`` by :func:`resolve`, so E2 cannot silently run a label E1 did
not choose. Nothing here reads a metric; picking the winner is
``selection.py``'s job.
