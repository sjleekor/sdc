"""run_matrix — run one stage of the preregistered matrix, then decide it.

Plan: ``docs/dev/20260907_model_experiment/06_implementation_plan.md`` §2.2, §4
(the commands), `03` §6 (what a run records), `05` §2 (the selection rules,
which live in ``selection.py``).

    uv run --extra analysis python -m research.models._02_updown_prob.experiments.run_matrix \\
        --stage E0 [--h 20] [--dry-run] [--smoke] [--summarize]

Four properties this runner is built to have.

**A stage cannot start without the previous stage's answer.** ``--stage E2``
resolves its label and model from ``results/E1/selection.json`` and refuses to
run if it is missing, so an inherited choice can never be made by default.

**Every run records what produced it.** ``run_spec.json`` carries the git sha, a
hash of the model code, the resolved run, the spec, and the contract hash of
every mart the panel was read from — the mitigation `06` §8 asks for against a
mart being rebuilt underneath the experiment.

**The panel is built once per config, not once per run.** The dataset key
excludes the seed and the model family, so E4a's extra seeds reuse the panel
their adopted config built.

**Predictions are written outside the repository.** ``results/`` keeps the small
frames that get committed; ``predictions_valid.parquet`` is hundreds of MB and
goes under ``data/``, with its path recorded in the summary (`03` §6).

**A stage is resumable, and can be run a horizon at a time.** A finished run is
reused when its recorded ``run_spec.json`` matches the run about to execute —
same resolved run, same spec, same ``code_hash`` — so ``--stage E2 --h 5`` today
and ``--stage E2`` tomorrow costs one stage, not two. A run interrupted midway
leaves ``run_spec.json`` without ``summary.json`` and is redone, because the
match requires both. ``--force-runs`` ignores the cache.

That matters beyond convenience: an eight-hour stage on a laptop that has to
move should not have to start over, and re-running a finished fit to satisfy the
runner would be a different (identical-seeded, but wasted) two hours.
