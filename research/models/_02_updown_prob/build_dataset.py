"""build_dataset — assemble model 02's panel from marts that already exist.

Plan: ``docs/dev/20260907_model_experiment/06_implementation_plan.md`` §2.2,
`02` §2 (PIT), §3.2 (interactions), §5 (universe, mart contract).

The difference from model 01's builder is what it is *not allowed* to do. Every
mart this model reads was published by a horizon-scan A0 run on snapshot
2026-08-23, and rebuilding one under a different contract hash would break the
comparability the whole experiment rests on (`02` §5). So the marts are
registered **read-only**, their stored contracts are copied into the dataset
manifest, and nothing here calls ``materialize``.

Three consequences worth knowing before reading the code.

**The contract hashes on that snapshot are not uniform.** A0 stamped its marts
with its config hash (``236d0d35…``); ``dim_universe_daily`` carries a different
one because a different path wrote it. ``register_mart_view``'s check is
all-or-nothing, so it cannot register both from one ``LakeConfig`` —
:func:`register_read_only` registers each as it lies and records what it found.
For the universe mart, which this model *could* define itself, the check is
replaced by a stronger one: its stored ``sql_hash`` must equal the hash of the
SQL this spec's ``UniverseFilter`` would produce (D-5), so reading it is
verified rather than assumed.

**The flow lag is a plain ``LAG`` over the mart's own rows.** That is correct
only because A0's ``feat_flow`` holds no halt sessions — ``flow.py`` filters on
``dim_price_quality_daily.valid_session_idx`` before any window runs (measured
on 2026-08-23: 0 halt rows out of 6,572,831). So "previous row" is "previous
valid session", which is what `02` §2 asks for.

**Interactions are built here, from the same percentile the rank profile uses.**
``ix_* = pct_rank(material) x regime`` via
:func:`research.etl.preprocess.per_date_rank_expr`, and the materials are then
dropped: they are Grade D on their own and FS2 carries only the interaction.
