"""F-9.9 — the readiness gate has to be passable at its own default.

`--required-coverage-ratio 1.0` is the documented default and it failed 33 of
38 features on snapshot 2026-09-08 for two reasons, neither of them a data
defect:

* the feature-date grid ran ten sessions past the end of the data, because
  `available_from_date` is an *announced* availability and `macro_cpi` /
  `macro_consumer_sentiment` legitimately carried 2026-09-21 while the last
  priced session was 2026-09-07. Every daily series was then charged with
  missing values for sessions that had not happened;
* a derived feature emits a row from its input's first date but cannot carry a
  value until its window fills, so a YoY series has a structurally NULL run at
  the front (253 dates for `macro_cpi_yoy_latest`). Judging from the first
  *fact* charged that run forever.

Both are fixed by narrowing what is judged, so the tests that matter most are
the ones proving the narrowing did not also swallow a real defect.
