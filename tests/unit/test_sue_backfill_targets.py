"""F-6.1 — which receipts the `fin_sue` backfill should actually fetch.

The narrowing rule is the whole substance of this script, and it rests on one
fact read out of `features/sue_event.py` rather than out of prose:
`comparative_eps` comes from `value_lag_4q`, the comparative column inside the
*same* filing, so one filing yields one `seasonal_change` and a `fin_sue` value
needs nine consecutive filings -- not thirteen.

Two ways this could be quietly wrong, both tested:

* fetching everything missing. 25,370 receipts lack XBRL but 2,670 of them sit
  in windows containing a quarter that was never filed, and no fetch closes
  those;
* fetching too little. A receipt that participates in *any* completable window
  has to be a target even if most of its windows are hopeless.
