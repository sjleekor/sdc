"""``feat_filing_activity`` — disclosure activity from receipts we already hold (N5-7).

The features themselves are counts, so most of what can go wrong is timing.
These tests run the real SQL over small synthetic panels where the correct
answer is countable by hand, and the ones that matter pin the point-in-time
rule: a receipt filed on day D must not be visible on day D.
