"""Unit tests for collection-target resolution (T group).

The last test in this file is the point of the module. Six services each
resolved their own targets and each independently reached for the
currently-listed set — six identical, invisible decisions, all wrong for a
historical backfill. Adding an opt-in flag per service does not fix that; the
next collector defaults the same way.

So the enforcement is a test that fails when a service goes around the shared
resolver, in the same spirit as ``test_catalog_covers_all_pipeline_tables``.
