"""F-5.1/F-5.2 — the five metrics added to `metric_rules` (PoC 6-8).

Each assertion here stands for a measurement in
`docs/dev/20260907_additional_feature/poc/metric_rules_ext.md`, so a future edit
that quietly drops one of them fails rather than silently narrowing coverage:

* short-term borrowings needs *three* spellings. With only the two `ifrs` forms
  its 2015 cross-sectional coverage is 0.003; `dart_ShortTermBorrowings` takes
  the same year to 0.823. This is the `ifrs-full_`-only mistake F-5.0 caught,
  and it would be invisible in any test that only checks "a rule exists";
* `borrowings` is deliberately NOT one metric. A mapping rule picks one winner
  per (metric, corp, period, basis), so the sum lives in `feat_fin_risk`;
* `rnd_expense` is deliberately absent — measured, rejected, and the two
  families that needed it cancelled;
* the 29 metrics that existed before are still all there. Their *values* are
  frozen by `golden/stock_metric_fact.json`; what this file adds is that none
  of them was renamed or absorbed.
