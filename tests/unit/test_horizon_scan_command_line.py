"""F-9.10 — run_spec must record the arguments the run actually used.

`command_line = ["horizon_scan", *(argv or [])]` looked right and was wrong for
every real invocation: `__main__` calls `main()` with `argv=None`,
`parse_args(None)` then reads `sys.argv` on its own, and the empty list is what
reached `run_spec.json`. All four 2026-08-30 runs recorded `['horizon_scan']`.

`config_hash` pins the analysis contract either way, so no run's lineage was
ever ambiguous. What was lost is narrower and still matters: you cannot
reproduce a run from its own spec. These tests pin both call shapes, because
the passed-argv one always worked and must keep working.
