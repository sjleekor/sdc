"""Unit tests for the run matrix, its selection rules, and the runner (PR7).

The registry is a preregistration, so the first test reads the run counts out of
`05_experiment_matrix.md` itself: if the document and the code disagree about
how many runs a stage has, one of them was edited without the other.

The selection tests matter for the same reason. Every rule in `05` §2 is a
sentence that has to mean one thing — "the lower log-loss inside a label, the
economic metric across labels, ties to L-A" — and these pin which one.
