"""Unit tests for the source-blocked circuit breaker.

Every collector treats a failed request as a per-item error: record it, move on.
That is right for one bad ticker and wrong for a source that has started
refusing, because the loop then works through its whole target list against a
server already saying no. A market-cap backfill is 6,000 slices retried four
times each, so a sustained block becomes 24,000 requests — which is how a
temporary throttle becomes a lasting one.

Nothing in this repo guarded against that: the KRX MDC adapters back off 45-180s
after an error, but the pykrx path had no error backoff and nothing anywhere
stopped a run.
