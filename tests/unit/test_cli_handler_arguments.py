"""Every ``args.<name>`` a handler reads must be a dest its parser defines.

This is the cheapest possible check and it was missing, so two commands shipped
in v0.9.4 that died on their first line:

    AttributeError: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'include_delisted'

Both were stale references left by the T-group rename of ``--include-delisted``
to ``--universe-scope``. Neither is reachable by unit tests that call the
service directly, and both sat inside f-strings, so nothing typed-checked them.
``prices backfill`` is the daily incremental price job and ``prices
market-cap-backfill`` is the N1 backfill — the two highest-volume commands in
the pipeline, broken at the entry point, deployed to prod.

A handler crashing on argument access is not a subtle bug; it is a bug that any
invocation reveals. What was missing is an invocation. Rather than smoke-run
every command (they all need a DB), walk the parser tree for the dests each leaf
command actually defines and AST-scan its handler for the attributes it reads.
