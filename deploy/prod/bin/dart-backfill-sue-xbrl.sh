# F-6.2 — receipt-targeted XBRL backfill so `fin_sue` can exist.
#
# `fin_sue` has never been measured: effective_start 2025-05-02, coverage 0.00,
# all six event cells `insufficient`. The formula was never the problem. XBRL
# captured against *original* periodic receipts is too sparse for any ticker to
# reach the nine consecutive quarterly filings the statistic needs, so F-6.1
# derived the receipts that would close a nine-quarter window and left 22,700 of
# them in a JSON-lines target file (results/sue_backfill_targets_202609.md).
#
# WHY A DRIVER AND NOT ONE LONG RUN
#
# Measured on 50 targets, 2026-09-09 22:58 KST: 28 s, so 1.79 req/s and the
# whole file is about 3 h 31 min. That is far too long to stop before a
# scheduled opendart job, and F-9.3 established the rule this driver follows —
# a wall-clock guard only holds if the work unit is shorter than the interval
# between checks. So the unit here is one chunk of DART_SUE_CHUNK_SIZE targets:
# 500 is about 280 s, short enough that a guard checked BETWEEN chunks means
# something.
#
# Three guards, the same three (and the same values) as
# dart-backfill-s1-remainder.sh, because the constraint is identical:
#
#   1. Self lock (non-blocking). Two overlapping triggers must not both drive
#      the queue; the second exits 0 rather than fighting for the opendart lock.
#   2. Blackout 02:30-05:00. The daily chain runs 04:00-04:04. A chunk admitted
#      at 02:29 ends about 02:34, so the margin is over an hour.
#   3. Deadline 23:00. `sdc_daily_opendart_filings` runs 23:30-23:44 and shares
#      both the opendart lock and the API quota. As in the S-1 driver the
#      deadline closes only the evening side, so a 00:10 trigger is admitted and
#      the 00:00-02:30 stretch is usable.
#
# Each chunk takes and releases the opendart lock itself, so the lock is free
# between chunks and a daily job can slip in even inside an open window.
#
# WHY THIS ONE CALLS docker compose ITSELF
#
# `sdc_run_daily_collector` cannot pass a volume, and the target file has to be
# visible inside the container. The collector service's only mount is
# ./state:/state, which exists solely for the KIS token cache -- repurposing it
# would make that comment false. So the chunk runs under `sdc_with_source_lock`
# (the part that matters) with its own `docker compose run -v`. This is a manual
# backfill, not a scheduled wrapper.
#
# STOPPING. No coverage check is needed. The service checks
# `dart_xbrl_document` keys AND the slice ledger *before* issuing a request, so
# a completed chunk costs zero API calls, and a `no_data` answer is recorded in
# the ledger with no TTL and never retried. That is the F-9.3 failure closed:
# unrecoverable targets retire permanently instead of costing the same requests
# on every run. Once the file is done a full pass is container startup only.
#
# Exit 75 from a chunk means every OpenDART key hit its daily limit. Clean stop,
# propagated so the run ends and the next trigger resumes. With nine keys
# configured the daily budget is 90,000, so this file fits inside one day's
# quota and 75 is not expected here.
